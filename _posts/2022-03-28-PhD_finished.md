Finally! 3 years of challenges and a lot a lot of hard work has come to a happy ending. 3 Months ago I succesfully defended my PhD! 

It has been 3 months already and I am still diguisting the whole thing. Many learning experiences, pitfalls, ups and downs, and wonderful people along this journey. 

I am moving on to use what I learned into the workforce finally. Stay tuned!
