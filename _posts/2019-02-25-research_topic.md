My area of research is music information retreival. You can find more details about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_information_retrieval) if you are new in the club.

At the moment, I am working on music recommendation. I am trying to use contextual information, such as your current activity/mood/location to recommend the suitable music for this context. If this is solved, you won't be recommended your favorite metal song when you're trying to sleep (well.. unless that's what you like). 

My research involves studying the different contexts that require different music preferences. It also involves studying the acoustic characterestics of the songs that influence these preferences. 

Stay tuned!
