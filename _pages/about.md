Hi! You have reached my webpage. Here, it's all about music and science. I am a PhD student working on music recommendation at [Télécom ParisTech](https://www.telecom-paristech.fr/) in collaboration with [Deezer](https://www.deezer.com/en/). I am supervised by Dr. Gaël Richard and Dr. Jeoffroy Peeters from Télécom ParisTech and Jimena Royo-Letelier and Florian Lesaint from Deezer. My research interest lies in Music Information Retreival and application of deep learning in music technology.

Prior to joining Télécom ParisTech, I graduated with a M.Sc. in Computer science from [The National University of Singapore (NUS)](http://nus.edu.sg/) where I worked on [The Problem of Singing Voice Intelligibility](http://scholarbank.nus.edu.sg/handle/10635/148567). Before that, I finished another M.Sc. in Software Engineering from [Nile University, Cairo](http://nu.edu.eg/), where I worked on primary/ambient audio source separtion.
Additionally, I did a 3-month internship at IBM labs in Singapore working on question-answering and another 6-month thesis internship at Sony's Stuttgart Technology Group working on source separation.
